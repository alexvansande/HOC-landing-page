Turing machines are linear. We have been making computers faster by adding more machines. Fortunately, there are other ways to compute. [Interaction nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_nets) work in parallel by transforming any computation into a series of symbols which transform themselves according to internal rules. All of this happens at the same time, much like slime molds solving a maze, or ancient trade routes, or neurons. They also come with built-in proofs that they’re bug-free.

We believe them to be the future, and we’re building that future. Come [learn](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/kind) and [help](https://discord.gg/kindelia) us.
